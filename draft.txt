1. User Input

    Users interact with a Streamlit-based UI to:
        Select stock symbols.
        Specify a date range.
        Upload datasets if needed.

2. Data Retrieval & Preprocessing

    Fetching Data: Uses yfinance to download stock prices (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume).
    Data Cleaning:
        Handles missing values using forward and backward filling.
        Aligns stock data for multiple tickers.
    Feature Scaling: Uses StandardScaler to normalize numerical features.

3. Feature Engineering (Implemented in Code)

    Lagged Features: Creates shifted versions of closing prices (Close_t-1, Close_t-2).
    Rolling Statistics: Computes moving averages and standard deviations over fixed windows.
    Lagged Correlation Analysis: Identifies leading and lagging stock relationships.

4. Machine Learning Model (XGBoost with Time-Series Cross-Validation)

    Model Selection: Uses XGBoost, a gradient boosting model for time-series forecasting.
    Time-Series Splitting:
        Uses TimeSeriesSplit instead of a fixed 80%-20% train-test split.
        Ensures the model trains on past data and tests on future data.
    Boosting Process in XGBoost:
        The model builds 100 sequential decision trees, where each new tree corrects the previous oneâ€™s errors.
        It minimizes residual errors using gradient boosting, adjusting predictions step-by-step.
    Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizes learning rate, max depth, and number of estimators.
    Performance Evaluation:
        RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
        MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)

5. Prediction & Visualization

    Generates Predictions: The trained XGBoost model forecasts stock prices.
    Visualization Tools:
        Actual vs. Predicted Prices (Line chart).
        Feature Importance Analysis (Bar chart).
        Correlation Heatmaps (For multi-stock relationships).

6. Deployment & User Interaction

    Streamlit-Based UI:
        Allows users to input stock tickers, view analysis, and receive real-time forecasts.
        Provides interactive correlation heatmaps and stock trend insights.
